========================================

[J. Koch](https://github.com/jkochNU)

scQubits is an open-source Python library for simulating superconducting qubits. The datapyc package provides a GUI tool
for loading and displaying experimental data, such as two-tone spectroscopy data. The GUI simplifies the extraction of 
data points from measurement results, as required for fitting experimental data to theoretical qubit models.

    pip install datapyc

Once done, you the application can be launched this way::

    python -m datapyc
