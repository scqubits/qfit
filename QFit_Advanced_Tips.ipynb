    "#### 1.1 Requirements for the data files\n",
    "`QFit` supports loading multiple spectroscopy data files and fit against all of them. There are a few requirements for the data files being loaded together:\n",
    "1. Each data file represent a single run two-tone spectroscopy experiment. It should  contains \n",
    "    - a few 2D spectroscopy arrays with the same shape (usually amplitude and phase) \n",
    "    - a few 1D arrays for coordinates. They should have the same length as the spectroscopy arrays' x or y dimension. When they are absent, especially when the data is just an image, `QFit` will generate the coordinate automatically.\n",
    "2. When being fit together, the data files should contain the same coordinates' names. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the above two requirements, `QFit` accepts various input data formats including hdf5, matlab, and images. We hope to make `qfit` as easy to use as possible. Reach out to us if you want to use `qfit` with your own data format."

    "1. **Choose your points wisely!** More points with distinctive x-value being selected = longer calculation time. You may want to select representative points for fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For transitions, selecting bare or dressed labels means that you mark your initial and final states using bare indices (states are labelled by excitations of individual subsystems) or dressed indices (states are regarded as eigenstates of the entire system and labelled as 0, 1, 2, 3,... in ascending order of energy). \n",
    "\n",
