    "#### Requirements for the data files\n",
    "You may wish to fit parameters with mutiple two-tone spectroscopy data, including (but not limited to) the following scenarios:\n",
    "- You performed a coarse scan over a wide range of DC voltage, and performed a more refined scan near the sweet spot of the qubit to resolve the qubit frequency.\n",
    "- Your device has multiple DC voltage sources to control magnetic flux and/or offset charge, and you need to determine the relation between input DC voltages and the tuning parameters, which has to be fully determined with multiple two-tone spectroscopies.\n",
    "`QFit` supports loading multiple spectroscopy data files and fit against all of them. There are a few requirements for the data files being loaded together:\n",
    "1. Each data file represent a single run two-tone spectroscopy experiment. It should  contains \n",
    "    - a few 2D spectroscopy arrays with the same shape (usually amplitude and phase) \n",
    "    - a few 1D arrays for axes coordinates. They should have the same length as the spectroscopy arrays' x or y dimension. When they are absent, especially when the data is just an image, `QFit` will generate the coordinate automatically.\n",
    "2. All the data files used within the fitting session should contain the same coordinates' names (i.e. \"voltage\" for the DC voltage source axes).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above two requirements, `QFit` accepts various input data formats including hdf5, matlab, and images. We hope to make `QFit` as easy to use as possible. Reach out to us if you want to use `QFit` with your own data format."
